Who am I? Writing an about me section is always a time for self-reflection and let’s be fair, a large amount of head-scratching. I’m going to try and answer the three main questions:

- Who am I?
- What drives me?
- Where I want to be?

## Who am I?

My name is Sam Jenkins. I’ve been working in consulting and software development since 2007. I’ve more recently moved into the project management space and have managed a wide variety of projects. These have ranged from small software delivery projects to year-long business change projects, spanning the entire UK.

## What drives me?

I am driven towards projects and roles that allow me to have a positive impact on people’s lives. My main passion is supporting and improving the safety and security of people from violence, abuse or terrorism. Improving a companies bottom line doesn’t quite do it for me.

I am quite competitive and like to strive to make myself better. Whether this is to be better at a particular skill, being a better person or being a better partner.

## Where I want to be?

If there’s a question harder than who are you it’s who you want to be and is something that develops over our lifetimes.

## Qualifications

As is normal for an about me section, I feel compelled to include a qualifications section. This being said our experiences are our greatest qualification, which we should always strive to expand.
