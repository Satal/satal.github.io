This is one of the reasons why I love LINQ, its so easy to do something like randomise a list in just one line that used to take a few lines.

The only thing you need to remember with this code is that you need to have specified that youâ€™re using System.Linq in order for it to work.

```csharp
List myCollection = new List();

myCollection = myCollection.OrderBy(a => Guid.NewGuid()).ToList()
```
