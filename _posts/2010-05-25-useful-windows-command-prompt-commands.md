This is a list of command lines for Windows that I have found really useful.

I will be updating this list when I find other command lines that I have found useful. If you know of any command lines that you think should be included in this list but I haven’t includeded then please feel free to let me know and I will add them to the list.

**appwiz.cpl** This will take you directly into the add/remove programs control panel page.

**hostname** This command line provides you with the name of the current computer.

**systeminfo**  
This command line provides you with a large amount of information about the current system.

**ver** This will provide you with information about what version of Windows you are running, for example at work I receive *“Microsoft Windows XP \[Version 5.1.2600\]*” and at home I receive “*Microsoft Windows \[Version 6.1.7600\]*” which is Windows 7.
