One of the great things that I love about being a developer is the in-jokes, the jokes which as a developer you laugh at because it’s sad how true they are. Things like XKCD and Dilbert always make me smile, everyone has seen XKCD (if not then you have my permission to stop reading and go spend a couple hours on the website, you can thank me later) I love these jokes which some people outside of development might not get.

I recently found a few posts with a number of animated GIFs which the author had provided captions to which I thought I would share with you, the link for the original posts are at the end but here are a few of my favourites;

If you know me you’ll know that storing passwords plain text is something that really disgusts me so I thought this one was appropriate
