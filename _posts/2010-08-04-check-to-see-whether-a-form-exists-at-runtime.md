If you want to check whether a form exists in your project at runtime  
you can use the following method, you will need to ensure that you  
import System.Reflection in order for this to work.

```vbnet
''' <summary>
''' This method deals with checking whether a form exists within the current project
''' </summary>
''' <param name="formName">The name of the form that you wish to check its existance</param>
''' <returns>True if the form exists and False if the form doesn't exist</returns>
''' <remarks></remarks>
Public Shared Function formExists(ByVal formName As String) As Boolean
    Dim myAssembly As Assembly
    Dim frm As Form = Nothing
    Dim assemblyName As String

    Try
        myAssembly = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly
        assemblyName = myAssembly.FullName.Split(",")(0)
        frm = myAssembly.CreateInstance(assemblyName & "." & formName)
    Catch ex As Exception
    End Try

    Return frm IsNot Nothing
End Function
```

Please note the reason that we are using Assembly.GetEntryAssembly rather than Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly is that if we was to put our code into a DLL for example, then the executing assembly would be the dll which in most cases wouldnâ€™t contain the forms. Obviously if your forms and the code that gets the form are held in the DLL then you would want to use Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly.
