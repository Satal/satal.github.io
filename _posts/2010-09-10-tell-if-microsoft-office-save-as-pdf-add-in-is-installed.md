In this VB.Net Tutorial/Code Example Iâ€™m going to show you how to check whether the Microsoft Office 2007 Save As PDF addin (available from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=7)) is installed.

```
<pre class="brush: vbnet; gutter: true">Public Shared Function isPDFSaverInstalled() As Boolean
    Dim rtn As Boolean
    Dim key As RegistryKey = Registry.LocalMachine.OpenSubKey("SoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall{90120000-00B0-0409-0000-0000000FF1CE}")
    rtn = key IsNot Nothing
    key.Close()
    Return rtn
End Function
```
