Hello Internet, it’s been a while! My last update was written in January 2014! This is obviously a very long time ago and a lot has happened in my life since then. The primary change in my life is that I have moved away from primarily working in development roles into more business consulting and project management. This means that while I might still post the occasional piece of code or tech they are likely to be less frequent.

![The future next exit](https://samjenkins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/the-future-11-300x150.jpg)

# So what happens next?

I’m not going to start promising that I’ll be posting regular content but I have wanted to get back to putting up information that I find useful and share solved problems. The subjects you’re likely to see content around are:

- Project Management
- MS Office Skills 
    - Excel
    - Project
- Presentation skills
- Professionalism

In my professional life, I’m putting together training material for a couple talks that I am working on. Once I’ve started to get these to a position where I’m happy to share them with you then I might start putting these up and seeing what people think of them.

I am also in the process of going through a lot of the old draft posts that I have written on here, if any are nearly complete, up to scratch and are still relevant then I may choose to publish them

Anyway, hopefully, this won’t be the last post for another three years but only time will tell.
