Identifying what risks you hold across your IT infrastructure is a key part of any risk management strategy. This is especially true when it comes to your data. If you don't know what risks you hold, you can't manage them. This is why it's important to have a risk management strategy in place. 

To help you identify what risks you hold, I've put together a list of IT risk prompts. These prompts will help you identify what risks you hold across your IT infrastructure. This isn't an exhaustive list, and not all of the items on this list will be applicable to all organisations but it should give you a good starting point.
